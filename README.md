# SHELL_SCRIPTING_TUTORIALS
Here I will teach you from the basic to the advance stuffs of shell programming. The credits actually goes to the guy who created a playlist called "Shell Scripting Tutorial For Beginners", which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS1QulWo1RIYmaxcEqw5JhK3b-6rgdWO_   
I am inspired by his work. I am learning from this playlist by doing the actual coding on my terminal, modifying them a little. Basically I am converting these videos into text, with some alteration. All the credits of this work goes to the channel where the playlist is available. You can find the link here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs6nmQViDpUw0nuIx9c_WvA
I will keep the file "SHELL_SCRIPTING_TUTORIALS.txt" regularly updated. Stay tuned!
