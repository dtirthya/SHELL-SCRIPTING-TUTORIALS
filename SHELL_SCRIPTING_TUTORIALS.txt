#System variables

echo $BASH

echo $PWD

#We can print in this way

echo YOUR PRESENT WORKING DIRECTORY IS: $PWD

#Declaring and printing a variable

name=MAX
echo HI $name! #To access the value of the variable, we have to pt a $ before it.

#Reading user input

echo "ENTER NAME: "
read var_name #Name of the variable in which we want to store
echo HELLO $var_name!

#Reading multiple inputs

echo "ENTER NAMES: "
read name_one name_two name_three
echo "THE NAMES ARE: $name_one, $name_two, $name_three"

#Another way

read -p 'USERNAME: ' user_name #Reading on the same line
echo USERNAME: $user_name

#Read hidden text (for example, a user's password)

read -p "USERNAME: " user_name
read -sp "PASSWORD: " pass_word
echo YOUR USERNAME IS: $user_name AND PASSWORD IS: $pass_word!

#Creating an array and displaying

echo "ENTER THE NAMES: "
read -a names
echo "NAMES: ${names[0]}, ${names[1]}"

#If we dont specify a varable when reading, the default variable 'REPLY' stores that data. For example,

echo "ENTER YOUR NAME: "
read
echo HELLO $REPLY!

#Passing arguments

$1 $2 $3 #First argument starts from $1. Then from there the number increases accrding to the number of arguments like $1, $2, $3,...,$n upto 'n' arguments. $0 is the shell script itself.
args=("$@") #Stores the arguments in an array
echo ${args[0]}, ${args[1]}, ${args[2]} #Prints the elements of the array
echo $@ #Prints all the arguments
echo $# #Prints the number of arguments

#if statement

#File test operations

#Checking whether a file is there in our directory

read name

For block special -b, and for character special -c. -s checks whether the file is empty or not. -r,-w,-x flags checks whether the fle has read, write or execute permissions respectively.

#Use of AND operator

#Use of OR operator

#We can use both AND and OR operators like this:
#Example 1: if [[ syntax_one && syntax_two ]]
#Example 2: if [[ syntax_one || syntax_two ]]
#Example 3: if [[ syntax_one -a syntax_two ]]
#Example 4: if [[ syntax_one -o syntax_two ]]
